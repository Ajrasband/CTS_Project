<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I was born in New York and grew up all around the Utah Valley and Salt Lake regions. I have been taught ever since I was little the value in hard work and time, and it's motivated me to try everything that I could. I played numerous sports, explored numerous educational opportunities, and tried making personalities fit certain trends. Now, as an 18 year old Freshman at BYU University, I know who I am and what I want to do.</p>
<p>I have a deep passion for creation and the power that it holds. You look up in the night sky and marvel about how that was made. You hold a new born in your arms and think of everything that happened in only 9 months to create this child. These feelings are some of the most personal and powerful feelings that an individual can feel connections too. And I believe that any project I create can have that same kind of effect.</p>
<p>I am a strong believer in Simon Sinek's philosiphy of converying Why, How, and What I do to establish a connection to people. And in a competition of early 2017, I found the power that those elements can hold over an audience. When conveying a hope for others as your why, you simultaneously nurture that same wonder and curiosity for creation that people get when they question the mysteries of life. They want to know your creation. They need to know. And in that moment you can create success.</p>
<p>I have worked hard to practice this and become familiar with what others need and want to know. This is what makes me happy and valuable. I want to make others want what you have, to see this "thing" as a "prize". My talents have prpared me for this, and I am able to apply them to whatever you need. I work extremely well with others and am able to become friends easily with them. I know the value that others hold in terms of experience and knowledge. People are a valuable resource that allow me to learn new things daily and to apply them correctly. Once I have learned, I am able to retain this knowledge extremely well and I am able to continually use it in practical and important applications.</p>
<p>As for the tech side of things, I am adept at using many tools available to me to create the tools for which your business can grow. I know many different coding languages, including but not limited to: Ruby on Rails, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. If you don't see what you need on this list, please feel free to contact me as I may be learning the language you're needing and haven't listed it as I am still working on it.</p>
